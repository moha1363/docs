If you run code scanning using multiple configurations, the same alert will sometimes be generated by more than one configuration. If an alert comes from multiple configurations, you can view the status of the alert for each configuration on the alert page. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-alerts-from-multiple-configurations)."
